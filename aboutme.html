   <h1 style="color:#9494b8; font-family:monospace">ROBOTS</h1>
     <img src="RobotLight.jpg" style="width:560px;height:315px">
     <p style="color:#9494b8; font-family:courier">This is a picture of the robot we used in class.  In the picture, the red light on the breadboard is turned on.  We struggled with making the white lightbulb turn on at first, but in the end we figured it out.  We had to move the jumper wires around until they were connected to the lightbulb.  We also found out how to make the red button work so that if it was pressed, the white lightbulb would turn on.</p>

     <p style="color:#9494b8; font-family:courier">While we were making our LED light show, I learned how to make the bi-color LED light bulb combine two colors together.  All we had to do was make the green and red color blink at the same time to get the orange light.  </p>
    <h1 style="color:#9494b8; font-family:monospace">REFLECTIONS</h1>
     <p style="color:#9494b8; font-family:courier">JULY 10: I used to think that robots were just toys that kids could play with, but after learning more about robots and their uses today, I feel like robots can change the world for good.  During class, we talked a lot about people who created robots to help those with disablities.  I know that with the advancements in technologies, robots will be able to help even more people.  I really enjoyed working with my group today because they were really willing to try different methods to make the circuit more complex.  They also did not give up when things weren't going as planned.</p>
     <p style="color:#9494b8; font-family:courier">JULY 12: Ayanna Howard and Manuela Velosa both created robots that helped people by making their life more efficient. Ayanna Howard created an Access4Kids device to allow the motor impaired to use tablets.  Manuela Velosa created a robot that could guide people to different locations and deliver packages to different rooms.  My team worked together on the lightshow by checking our code together and coming up with unique ideas for how the lights should flash.  The basic peices of every Arduino sketch are variables, functions, pinMode(), digitalWrite(), delay(), setup(), and loop().
