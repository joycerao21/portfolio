   <h1 style="color:#9494b8; font-family:monospace">ROBOTS</h1>
     <img src="RobotLight.jpg" style="width:300px;height:250px">
     <p style="color:#9494b8; font-family:courier">This is a picture of the robot we made in class.  We struggled with making the white lightbulb turn on at first, but in the end we figured it out.  We had to move the jumper wires around until they were connected with the lightbulb.  We also found out how to make the button work so that if it was pressed, the white lightbulb would turn on.</p>
    <h1 style="color:#9494b8; font-family:monospace">REFLECTIONS</h1>
     <p style="color:#9494b8; font-family:courier">JULY 10: I used to think that robots were just toys that kids could play with, but after learning more about robots and their uses today, I feel like robots can change the world for good.  During class, we talked a lot about people who created robots to help those with disablities.  I know that with the advancements in technologies, robots will be able to help even more people.  I really enjoyed working with my group today because they were really willing to try different methods to make the circuit more complex.  They also did not give up when things weren't going as planned.</p>
